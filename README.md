# Simple Linked List in C++

This repository contains an implementation of a simple singly linked list in C++. It includes basic operations for manipulating the list. This project is designed for those looking to understand the fundamentals of linked list data structures and learn how to implement them in C++.

## Features

### Insertion

- **insertAtBeginning**: Insert a student at the beginning of the list.
- **insertAtEnd**: Insert a student at the end of the list.
- **insertAtPosition**: Insert a student at a specific position in the list.

### Deletion

### Navigation

- **first**: Get the first student in the list.
- **last**: Get the last student in the list.
- **next**: Get the student next to a given age.
- **previous**: Get the student previous to a given age.

### Utility

- **isEmpty**: Check if the list is empty.
- **Size**: Get the number of students in the list.
- **initialize**: Initialize or reset the list.
